<h2>ABOUT THELONIUS RECORDS</h2>

<p>Thelonious Records is an independent record label established in 2001 to bring you the finest jazz recordings both old and new. The Idea for
this label grew out of the frustration that developed within the Monk clan as they watched more and more Monk material get pirated in other
countries with no regard for the artist or his rights. Thelonious Sphere Monk has never seen the financial benefit due an artist of his stature.
Out of that frustration a resolve developed that has led to a modern day David and Goliath. Without precedent a suit was brought and won in
France denting the armour of the pirates of bootleg misinformed Thelonious Sphere Monk performances. All of our offerings have never been
officially released, and many were previously unknown. We are accumulating all of these bootleg concerts, but have a rich cache of pristinely
recorded material as it stands. We have uncovered Monk material here in the U.S. that has only been heard by a handful of people, privately
recorded, never released, never pirated. We are uncovering more material as time goes on.

<br><br>

In 2001 we recovered the earliest recording of the Thelonious Monk Quartet featuring Charlie Rouse, Live at the Five Spot in 1958. This is
material that has only been heard by the audience in attendance back in 1958 and those involved in its mastering today! We expect the crown
jewel of our offerings will be the "Cat House" tapes. These are private recordings recorded by Nellie Monk, and the Baroness Pannonica
DeKoenigswarter. Many were recorded at Monk's home and the home of the Baroness where many artists did their own recordings over the
years. Many were recorded at the New York Jazz clubs. This collection represents the evolution of the talents of many of the jazz greats you
know and love. Artists represented in this collection include Sonny Rollins, Clark Terry, Monk, Bird, Horace Silver, and the list goes on. There
are over 250 hours of material that include the intimate conversations between the artists, as well as the earliest renditions of many of their
best tunes.</p>

<h3 style="color:#30a0ae;">"You know, anybody can play a composition and use far-out chords and make it sound wrong.
It’s making it sound right that’s not easy."

<section class="bio-info">
<p style="color:#000;">With the arrival Thelonious Sphere Monk, modern music—let alone modern culture--simply hasn’t been the same. Recognized as one of the
most inventive pianists of any musical genre, Monk achieved a startlingly original sound that even his most devoted followers have been unable
to successfully imitate. His musical vision was both ahead of its time and deeply rooted in tradition, spanning the entire history of the music
from the “stride” masters of James P. Johnson and Willie “the Lion” Smith to the tonal freedom and kinetics of the “avant garde.” And he shares
with Edward “Duke” Ellington the distinction of being one of the century’s greatest American composers. At the same time, his commitment
to originality in all aspects of life—in fashion, in his creative use of language and economy of words, in his biting humor, even in the way he
danced away from the piano—has led fans and detractors alike to call him “eccentric,” “mad” or even “taciturn.” Consequently, Monk has
become perhaps the most talked about and least understood artist in the history of jazz..
<br>

Young Monk turned out to be a musical prodigy in addition to a good student and a fine athlete. He studied the trumpet briefly but began
exploring the piano at age nine. He was about nine when Marion’s piano teacher took Thelonious on as a student. By his early teens, he was
playing rent parties, sitting in on organ and piano at a local Baptist church, and was reputed to have won several “amateur hour” competitions
at the Apollo Theater.
<br>

Admitted to Peter Stuyvesant, one of the city’s best high schools, Monk dropped out at the end of his sophomore year to pursue music and
around 1935 took a job as a pianist for a traveling evangelist and faith healer. Returning after two years, he formed his own quartet and played
local bars and small clubs until the spring of 1941, when drummer Kenny Clarke hired him as the house pianist at Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem.</p>
